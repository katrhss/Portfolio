                I'm 20 years old, studying Computer Science at the University of

                  2023 is the year I started to get more deeply involved in
                  programming. I worked with Anastasia Magopoulou on a project
                  where we developed a mobile application for the 4th
                  programming competition "Kozani 2030: On the road to climate
                  neutrality". The app was developed using React-Native, which
                  gave me not only a first look at mobile development, but also
                  a general knowledge of React, which is the goal of my year. At
                  the beginning of the academic year I had the honour to become
                  the President of the IEEE Student Branch University of Western
                  Macedonia, Kastoria. During the year, together with the other
                  members of the Student Branch Board, we organised several
                  workshops and seminars, including a seminar on LaTeX, which
                  was held in cooperation with the School of Science of the
                  University. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to participate
                  in the 16th IEEEXtreme Programming Contest, which helped me to
                  improve my knowledge of JavaScript, which was my preferred
                  language. It also helped me develop better algorithmic
                  thinking.

                  In 2022, being in the second year of my studies, I had a
                  better contact with both programming and the more general
                  technologies surrounding the field of Computer Science. I
                  continued to develop my knowledge of C, while at the same time
                  attending some courses from "Huawei ICT Academy" through
                  Huawei's cooperation with the University of Western Macedonia,
                  where I study. In November 2022, I was honoured to be
                  appointed Vice President of the IEEE Student Branch University
                  of Western Macedonia, Kastoria. Within the Student Branch, I
                  had the opportunity to work on projects that helped me develop
                  both my soft and hard skills. I was responsible for workshops,
                  conferences and seminars organised by the Student Branch
                  itself, or co-organised with the support of the University.

                  technologies and saw different perspectives on topics taught
                  at the university.

                  In the earlier years of my life, I had very little contact
                  with programming, as I didn't have the right tools and
                  knowledge to get started properly. In my spare time, I learned
                  the basics of Python, and I also saw some very basic parts of
                  HTML in some of my high school classes.
